======
Detecting compact binary mergers from gravitational wave strain data using neural networks, with an emphasis on
- **Efficiency** - making effective use of accelerated hardware like GPUs in order to minimize time-to-solution
- **Scale** - validating hypotheses on large volumes of data to obtain high-confidence estimates of model performance
- **Flexibility** - modularizing functionality to expose various levels of abstraction and make implementing new ideas simple
- **Physics first** - taking advantage of the rich priors available in GW physics to build robust models and evaluate them accoring to 
meaningful metrics
- **Multi-messenger astronomy** - making algorithmic decisions and optimizations that allow for extremely low-latency alerts
